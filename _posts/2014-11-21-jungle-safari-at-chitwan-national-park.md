Don't expect what you see in the photo when you visit Chitwan National Park. Hope the best and you can spot deers, wild bores, monkey, peacock and other wildlifes and maybe snakes if you have good eyes and Rhino too. But may not be close and may not be bunch of them.   Chitwan National Park is one of the largest national park in Nepal and attracts lots of tourist from all over the world. If you want to know more about the place then <a title="Chitwan National Park Info" href="https://sites.google.com/a/woodward.edu/world-geography-wiki/wiki-projects/top-sites-of-south-asia/nepal-royal-chitwan-national-park" target="_blank">visit this site.</a> Toady I and my college friend Avash went there for a long time no see travel. I came to know he was interested in photography in the mid way.

We were there to sunbath, talk, sight seeing and drink and have good time. We did took some pictures and talked about how and what and amateur photographer things. We went there on a scooter, jungle safari. We visited 20000 (Bis Hajari tal).<a href="http://www.kandelvijaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/20000lake-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20" src="http://www.kandelvijaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/20000lake-1-1024x452.jpg" alt="20,000lake-1" width="700" height="308" /></a>

The last stop for us was SundarDada, which we weren't expecting to stop but the collapsed bridge crossing the small river made our small scooter not so able to cross it. We did have some drinks and meals there after buying sukuti from the other side of the river. We went there cautiously and the fun part is, Avas felt into the river on the way back. He soaked his pants but a memorable incident occurred.

We spotted deers and wild bores while we were returning. We had expected to see many deers walking and grazing, a lot closer to us to photograph them with 85mm lens on APSC sensor but thats a far cry for a wildlife photograph and so I'm not gonna share any photos that i tried taking with it because there are better photos out there on the internet easily available. But to see with the real eyes is a pleasing one. Lots of tourist were enjoying the sight. We were cautious not to miss any animals nearby as we were progressing back on a bumpy road through the middle of the dense jungle but the animals were more cautious not to be so close to us for at least that day or time. Wildlife sight is more a luck.

Anyway we enjoyed the day. It was great to hang out with old mate after a long time. After all he is the acid man, if you know what i mean. He has created a brilliant photography group, Photography for life. Check out if you are interested and as always if you have leave comments below.

Lastly, this one's for Avas.
