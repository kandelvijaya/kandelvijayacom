Human beings are change resilient even though they say they embrace change. Life is defined on Time. Time changes. So should we or not?

I moved from Tokyo because of Zalando. Its simple as that but there are few details that i had to take into considerations before deciding. Lets go see whats Tokyo like first.

Tokyo, epitome of human development and modern technology. I bet you that the advancement of toilet system will simply make your jaw drop. Just get into the TOTO toilet museum. It has all the sprayers, cold and hot, temperature controllable, speed controllable and i even don’t know what else. But its normal. Google for the 100 useless inventions and I’m pretty sure 90% of those will be Japanese. You might say hey, is that the way to compare advancement? I would say: who would invent something way out of mind if there were things needed already. With 15+ million people, bustling and colorful streets

and big hoarding boards and interesting artifacts everywhere; for me its simply lively and so close to home. Google for the most popular city and its Tokyo. The details are left to you.

Compared to Germany, theres low tax, awesome health insurance and medication facilities. There are some complaints about work hours but if you don’t work hard, you simply won’t go ahead.

So i had a good iOS engineering job on a startup company that was growing very rapidly.

I lived with my dad at Omotesando (Ginza and Omotesando are the most expensive place to live in Tokyo. Don’t ask me how?). Good food, healthy food, good life. I had friends and my family were moving to Tokyo in the coming few months including my mother, brother and grandma. But then still, i decided to pull this change. I decided to leave everything behind and move away from my family, from the place i was in love to. I moved to join Zalando SE.

I left everything behind at least momentarily and choose this move to Zalando. I didn’t move to Berlin, i moved to Zalando. But why?

Zalando said they have around 25 iOS developers working on the app. I was like what in the world are you making with those number of people? Zalando silently replied: something awesome. I felt for it. I felt for the fact, how amazing would it be to work on this big team for 2 reasons.

<strong>1:</strong> i always wanted to learn. I always want to improve. Sometime my wants exceed more than what i can but still i like to want to do new things. This was perfect for me if only i could see what goes in those 25 peoples head and learn a thing from each.

<strong>2:</strong> I wanted to experience working in a big team/ big company. This is to see how companies solve the problem of managing tasks, teams and people. Its really hard to manage 10 people let alone a company to manage more than 10,000 people. And with those amount of people comes the diversity in both technology and products.

From my initial impression during the on boarding month and the initial days with my team i have come to firmly believe that Radical Agility had a huge impact on the company and how people work. I will be describing what it is next time, however, its a way to ensure that a big company does not have to follow the same old slow and boring practice of work but rather each team can work like a startup inside the company in their own realm. This i believe is a profound change in mindset. The details are with me until next time.

Cheers!
