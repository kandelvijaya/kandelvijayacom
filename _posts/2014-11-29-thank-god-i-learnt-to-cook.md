I disliked cooking as much as i could,  until last year. I especially dislike to wash the dishes after everything is cooked and eaten. But I found myself eating junk food regularly, most of the time in the past year as i started living alone in this capital city of Nepal. My pocket money would be empty or sometimes i had diarrhea and stomach problem. These are the times i realize my father's saying "Eat healthy, don't eat outside".  And thats true but cooking at home comes with a price to pay for.

Typically, 1.5 hours is spared for a complete meal, from the inception, cooking, eating to washing dishes. It took me about 2 hours in the beginning and i was frustrated so as to move to junk foods, which are easy. Especially for a student like me, i don't have much time left to cook because i was interested to be busy not in the study but other various subject matter which really don't matter that much. At least that was me a year back from now. So 3-4 hours a day and that was a lot of time and energy to pay for a healthy but not so tasty diet only because i don't know how to make things tasty. But is it worth taking that time? Are there any shortcuts?
<blockquote>Warren Buffet said, "What you do and eat right now determines how you are going to look 20 years from now. Baby your body like the only car you have, don't let a dent appear, oil it and care it".</blockquote>
He is absolutely true. We only have this body to stick with so why not make it strong so we could last couple more decade.  Another fact is cooking at home certainly takes time but it saves a lot of money which can be used for vacation, datings and gifts. This is true for a student. And yes there are shortcuts to cooking fast but healthy but not so tasty. I'm gonna share you this idea.

Clean and soak the Daal in water overnight. While cooking rice in the morning, put that daal in a clean steel glass mixed with water, salt, food color and masala and put that glass into the pressure cooker with the clean rice in the middle. Now put some potatoes cleaned and shaved on top of rice water surrounding the  daal glass. Cook the rice. Your daal is also cooked and the potato is also cooked. Now take a fry pan or karai, put some oil, fry onions, garlic and chilly. Take some portion of the fried ingredients and pour over the daal. Thats your daal fry. Next chop the potato and put it in the fry, stir for 2-3 minutes and theres your curry. Server it and have it. It takes about 45 minutes to completely have a meal in doing so.

Anyways enjoy cooking and its worth the time invested.
