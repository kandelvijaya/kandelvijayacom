Language is more human intuition, context and emotional expression added to the words and its structured ruled combinations. Language is understood better in conversation to writing and to Google Translate. I have been walking through the language and appreciating these mere facts our human brain can so easily understand beyond whats spoken.

<!--more-->

The rise of AI and the big powerful machines are far from understanding what makes our small head so complex to understand the fact we “understand even when its not spoken”. Like the mood and the passion and the curiosity in the words. Our face has 44 distinct muscles, i know most aren’t aware and trained to move them voluntarily, which produces more than million combination of emotions and we are oblivious to it. But that does not mean our brain is. We don’t understand how we operate and how our memory works and how we detect these subtle but defining gestures and put it on top of the words and phrases and get the meaning. But Will computers do this?

Google Translate is the de facto translation tool which people might argue but is used more than any out there. Again, people might argue the translation is crappy and i hardly understand the meaning but they will use it when they are thrown to a land where everyone speaks something totally different language. So what is my point? What have i got to advertise Google Translate for?

We, Me and Bruce MacIntosh (Yes thats MacIntosh), are currently working on to provide a language “tool” that does better than whats out there. I say better but don’t jump off and take me for granted because we are actually doing differently to do things better. We can’t beat Google, no-one can, not even Apple. Yeah. I like google. I use google translate to translate Japanese emails. I get the meaning with some effort but the translated sentence are crap. Sometimes even the basic sentences are messed up. Thats why it seems potentially dangerous to speak out the translated sentence to the native speaker in fear he may not understand or worse get offended or more worse get the wrong meaning.

So besides that we allow user to compose a sentence. I mean we help the user compose a a sentence for example in english. You drag components, like why/how/when then SubjectVerbObject then At/Because/During and so on. You translate on sentence in one process. But we help you understand how a sentence is being built, about tense and negative and continuous states. By doing so we accomplish accurate translation for a complete phrase composed for your need. Second, you are learning and practicing the good sides of language instead of forcing your mind to type all the sentence in the google translate. Third, you can’t translate something because you feel like copy pasting the whole thing without any sense, if thats the case Google Translate it. We like to aid foreigner to travel and communicate on DAY ONE. And when they do use this tool, they will be assisted to accomplish that one sentence thats gonna make their life easy. Being a composer is lot different than inventing the whole sentence. The tool is expensive, 99$.

No, thats not true. Maybe around 5$. Im not sure. But do look out for Mac’sCommunicator at the end of this month to get a limited access to the app. If you want to be testing the app fro free on your device then please put your appllID down the comments.

Thanks again. Have a good time. Cheers!
