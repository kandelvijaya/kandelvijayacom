I started for this magnificent search in the hope i would get the just the simplest app to keep track of my 4-5 notes i have to see while programming iOS apps. But all i found was overwhelming number of complex TO-DO apps. I hate complexity mostly.

So i was left abandoned and so puzzled why didn’t some starter programmer developing Mac apps made and published a simple TO-DO app which i would have happily downloaded.

My problem: i wanted a app that sits on menubar, i click it and it shows me a small list of todos, i go do some more coding it hides. After a hour i feel like where am i, did i do something, i click the menu icon, i see the list. Check for myself. Add new ones if needed.

Thats it. No alerts, setting reminders, sounds, storing on online account, signup, no photo attachment, no network required, no big dialog window required, no dock icon required. All i could do was, when working in full screen mode on my 15 inch MBP, just look up on the menu bar and see a popover window with my 4-5 lists which my brain could refresh. Down to work again.

Frustrated i couldn’t find it, i decided to take off my 1 hour of iOS time and do some MacOSX app for the first time. I needed a platform, i know it was similar, i was not to learn about cool stuffs Mac can do. I needed to build this small popover list and thats all. I got a repo from github of Popover window from menu bar. Fantastic! Half work done. I learned some auto layout and made a text field and some lists to populate. It act like a heap.

And finally I’m sharing the app with you if you are like me who likes to have stupid simple things while you decide what next.

For developers check this github repo:

For users download and run it. Bear in mind you don’t quit this app, theres no easy way to do so.
