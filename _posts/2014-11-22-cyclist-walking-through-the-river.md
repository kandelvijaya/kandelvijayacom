When the bridge is brushed away by a high water, people often don't have much pleasing option. This profound especially on remote places nearby jungle where a bridge is "a" point of getting between two separate but needy places. Avas and myself, were to cross it on scooter but couldn't due to the same fact. We had a dead end for our day trip. But this cyclist, came up and never braked his bicycle as he dipped down into the river. We fixated our eyes on him. Unfortunately he didn't ride all the way. That would be a sight for video. But he carried on walking all the way. Isn't it amazing?
