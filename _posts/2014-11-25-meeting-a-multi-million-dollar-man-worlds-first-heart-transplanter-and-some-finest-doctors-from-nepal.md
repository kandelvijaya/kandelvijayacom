Luck, opportunity and dedication are all important to be success, rightfully said and explained in "The Outliers"by Malcolm Gladwell. It is a stunner statement which i underestimated for majority of my teenage life. But the practicality of this statement is ever so profound with ever upcoming endeavors of Hospitals Nepal, which we, Nagendra Ghimere and I started working as a interest project to make something interesting when we had nothing to do. We simply didn't imagined this day. When we started we asked ourselves what we could be. We said we could get people attention and maybe have about 6000+ downloads. That would be an underestimation given the opportunities we have got on the way due to this brain child of ours.

First and foremost, we met Dr. Subash Pyakurel of Health Concern and we collaborated together, Dr Subash team taking charge of promotional management while we take charge of development. We later divided the responsibility and share of the product which did get us some money to enjoy and to grow something else. We got to speak in Tourism Board infront of 100+ important delegates including foreign ambassadors from USA, UK, Australia, China and other 5 countries, senior doctors, policy makers form health division and the tourism board members itself. But who would have thought i would met a doctor who in the history of medical science, transplanted a human heart for the very first time; Dr. Kumod Dhital.

The world and his home country Nepal is proud of him. And i was very much honored to shake his hand and talk to him and let him inaugurate the SMS System for Grande International Hospital. Similarly, once i had watched on youtube for sepals 10 most rich people and found Dr. Upendra Mahotto. 700+million dollar man, and i meet him. He was superb. He was hard working and dedicated to what he did. And importantly, he was interested in this application of ours and had shifted many routines to make this day a success. I've heard Sanjay, one of my good friends from Budhanilkantha, studying MBBS, talking about Dr. Bhagwan Koirala. I got to talk to him as well. I previously sat with Dr. Bhola Rijal and even had a dinner at my uncles. Im glad to meet this wonderful bunch of people and be motivated and moved by their sheer determination and prestige. How would i ever think i would meet them? Im a IT guy.

Not to forget, i also meet and talked with Dr. Doors Platica, 2 billion dollar man from Cholera Medical during Reconnect program. Time is everything, luck is something and dedication is one thing. I really appreciate Malcolm Gladwell's "The outlier" and highly recommend to those who want to be successful and needs to know what it takes to get there.

Lastly, I've been several times on major newspaper and television. But the important thing is to be there once. I remember my sister saying when my mom read the news and found my name. Her tears rolled with pride and she told everyone she could that i was on news. Its a wonderful feeling when you prove to your parents that you are worth something. That first one was my biggest one.

Anyways I'm so honored to be what I'm today and huge thanks goes to Hospitals Nepal. Thank you to all the people who i met in the course of Hospitals Nepal and me till this day. Its been a slow but wonderful ride.
