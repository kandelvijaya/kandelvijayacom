<p class="p1">The above unreadable character set is a set of REGEX that will allow you to match email address in a given string. For instance: a javascript script to validate a string to be a email before you send it to the server.</p>
<p class="p1">The question is: how do we go about learning this unfriendly but so useful combination of characters?</p>
<p class="p1">This post is not a post per say. But a place to point you to different awesome resources which i will not just replicate for the sake of completeness or user retention.</p>
<p class="p1">One more truth before we proceed. The regexp we saw on the top is something i copied.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="p1">To get familar with what each character does and means. Go visit: <a href="http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/regex.htm" target="_blank">Regex Basics</a></li>
	<li class="p1">To get some practice for your knowledge from the previous point, Go Visit: <a href="https://regex101.com" target="_blank">REGEXP online</a></li>
	<li class="p1">After a while you might be saying, oh this is easy. To sharped what you've learnt and see theres more you can do, watch this video:</li>

Thats all i got for now. Hey but, if you want to master it theres a book on Amazon titled sensibly like "Mastering Regular Expression" which is 500+ pages of unfriendly characters explained.

If there are other resources which you would want to include but are not here, drop a comment. Thanks.
