This above set of Samosa and Curry (Tarkari) cost me about Rs. 130. Thats thrice the price i would pay if i were on most sweets shop in Kathmandu Valley? But this place is Malekhu, a most probable place for buses and vans carrying passengers from kathmadu to chitwan or pokhora to stop by and have some lunch. Is not it absurd?

I was travelling from Chitwan to Kathmandu to attend a press conference for Hospitals Nepal's SMS appointment System integrated by Grande International Hospital. It was 8 AM in the morning and i asked how much for plain rice. It was Rs.200. Chicken way up. So i thought its not worth it and asked for Samosa and when i heard it the first time, Rs.130 for 2 samosa and tarkari. I was shocked and sat down for a cup of tea instead. But i have this problem of getting hungry wherever i travel. I love to eat and i need to eat when the bus stops to eat. Its kind of a habit i built over the years of College at Budhanilkantha when i used to travel a lot from Kathmandu to Chitwan for my relationship. Later i asked for a plate of Samosa because its the cheapest thing i could have. That time i vowed to myself that i would carry a lunch box whenever i need to travel. Its more because what i get is not fresh and i pay 5 star price.

The Samosa was cold like ice. It was 8 AM and guess when they made it. In times like these, ask the provider was the samosa made yesterday or day before yesterday and you might get the right answer? Anyway, if you are like and have got this problem be cautious its not safe to eat in those places because of low sanitation, lack of health consciousness from the owner and the cook and more importantly due to its highly expensive price. Take time to come up with healthy idea.

As always, if you got any questions or queries, hit the comment below. Thank you. Have safe food while travelling. We don't want to suffer diarrhea while on bus. Do we?
