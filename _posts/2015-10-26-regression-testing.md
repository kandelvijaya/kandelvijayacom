<p><strong>Regression Testing:</strong><br />Notwithstanding the old joke, "Congress" is not the opposite of "progress;" "regress" is. For your code to regress is for it to "move backward," typically meaning that some bad behavior it once had, which you fixed, has come back. A "regression" is the return of a bug (although there can be other interpretations).</p><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3464629/what-does-regression-test-mean" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3464629/what-does-regression-test-mean</a></p><p><strong>Why?</strong><br />The only reason automated tests are valuable is to allow us to modify our own code later on preferably without breaking it.</p><p><strong>F.I.R.S.T. testing principles</strong></p><p><strong>Tests should be:</strong></p><p><strong>Fast</strong> — tests should be able to be executed often.<br /><strong>Isolated</strong> — tests on their own cannot depend on external factors or on the result of another test.<br /><strong>Repeatable</strong> — tests should have the same result every time we run them.<br /><strong>Self-verifying</strong> — tests should include assertions; no human intervention needed.<br /><strong>Timely</strong> — tests should be written along with the production code.</p><p><a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/bad-testing-practices/" target="_blank">https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/bad-testing-practices/</a></p><p>If you want to continue reading on and/or are insterested on more testing realted issues, do check this out:</p><p><a href="http://kandelvijaya.com/index.php/2015/10/24/mocking-vs-stubbing-art-of-unit-testing/" target="_blank">Mocking vs Stubbing: The are of Unit Testing</a></p>
