I don't think so, i started advertising just few days back and i started with just 10$ trial to promote a new page for page likes and guess what, i just got 2 likes out of it. The more interesting fact is that i can't see one of the person who liked it. The likes number did went up. This brought another question. If i can't see who likes the page, then is it not possible for Facebook to just increase the number count if they couldn't meet the demand but have already taken the money?

Any web developer can increase any counter if he had made and if people are willing to pay for it. I don't pin point Facebook but I'm in doubt about them until there is another explanation that convinces me. Â But the second thing is privacy.

I had never realized how big internet companies track each and every move we make so as to gain insights into our habit, take our personal details and analyze them to sell us adds or products. It is a great power for the advertising group to target people living in Shibuya, Tokyo aged 20-40 who are undergraduate and who like video games to advertise Playstation game. But for those whose data are being analyzed they get nothing especially. Should they not be rewarded for all those data set? Obviously and the reward is to allow them freely use the system. Its a smart design but remember everything you do and like and click on Facebook is being tracked to push adds to you, either you like it or not, its up to you. But as i started to advertise, i want some more then they offer. This craziness to advertise is the sole reason we are losing privacy in the internet world.

I still am studying the art of Facebook ads, i still need to do lot of research. But i have another intriguing question in mind. If so why would i not buy cheap Facebook likes?

Buying cheap Facebook likes has its advantage and disadvantages. First, if you want to show how big you are at the initial stage then its good. People intact like to like what other people chose to like and the way they know is by seeing how much like it has got. The bad news is, the liker are all just one time likes, they don't interact, see the post and are related to your costumer. The likes will come from like farms set up somewhere in Africa, Bangladesh or India where thousands nothing to do people are employed to like pages all day long. If you sign up for the page like these people get your page on the long list and likes it. If you want Facebook like count for various reasons then its okay but if you want engagement i suggest get generic fans.

One more, chose the likes seller carefully, they might steal your credit cards if they are really small and don't have a good reputation. Its something always to be worried of.

By the way, if you are in Japan or especially Tokyo and want to help me out then I'm really happy. Please go to this site and like it. <a title="NamasteShibuya" href="http://facebook.com/namasteshibuya" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/namasteshibuya</a>
