Biggest blow to a beautiful country of Nepal. The deadliest thing that could happen to us. It sure will have lot of future consequences impeding the development, production, sustainability, poverty, homelessness and lots to come out. But now, everyone is saving their lives and they should. Lots dead, more to be never found. Its a complete chaos, no food supply, no water supply, bad communication. Earthquake was the least expected thing to shook off. My soul goes to the whole nation and I'm sorry not to be in the country right now, defending this. This one is from my dairy.

<!--more-->Yesterday or today for me was the baddest day but if i were to describe in positive light, its a day i hoped  and hoped and prayed and  prayed and tried to contact  my loved ones in Nepal all day long for straight 12 hours and this is my break after the telecommunication lines are disrupted or the holders battery is already drained searching and being called. Its is devastating earthquake which showed no pity on the poor country of mine and the good people of my country. I would have been panicked and down to tears if i had not talked to my love, who luckily Vibered me as earthquake started shaking the nation. We talked and i gave some positive thoughts and asked to believe in the soil you stand but i would have done the other way if i were to know how bad it would be now. It was good for me to put some good sight in her. I remember clearly how worried she was.

“I wanted to talk to you badly if anything were to happen before”, she was weeping and sobbing but i suggested nothing can ever happen to her. Its just like all earthquakes be alert, be cautious and careful. Don’t panic. But its bit different if you were to listen this words. Although, she replied “Yes i will try to but….”. “I love you very much and thank you for notifying me”, i went on to appreciate her concern for me and i just wondered how much she must have missed me. I guess now, its evening, after the 8.1 rector scale earthquakes and series of 20 or more 6 rector tremors. Things are getting bad there. I happen to be 1000 miles away, in the another country which is equal to Nepal in terms of earthquake proness; Tokyo.

Its so bad. I just panicked all day trying to contact her as frequent as possible. I called her back because i thought its a kind of shock that alerts people maybe shook some dirt and go away but it was a historic shake. Later, after an hour. I couldn’t connect to her. I searched on the internet about the shake and there were no posts besides the one posted on BBC. Maybe editors and news person went outside instead of posting status on internet from their computer inside the room. BBC did save my life and i get to keep update. Every 15 minutes, i refreshed it and it showed and presented new information. Time after time, the death casualties would multiply, pictures of historical monuments were collapsed engulfing in the insiders to a myth. Dharahara, the UNSECO site went crumbling down and all it remained was a big pile of dirt. I saw some pictures of a man powered and covered in dust being plucked from inside the rumbles of a building. He looked like dead, but was alive. I wonder how many were inside and would all they be this lucky? Of course not, how can they when the ambulance gets no road to ride, cranes and equipments aren’t enough. And even if people are pumped out they are miserably wonded, broken limbs and scratched body, cloths tortured and ripped apart; how could the medical facilities who were then in the roads and grounds proving services service all those thousands and who knows how many. It is a complete mess in a already unstable economy.

Electricity cut off, no internet, telecommunication distorted by congestion who would have never imagined this many calls being made and food and water being gulped down.

Thankfully everything happened in the midday so we had some time to prepare and do our best as we can. I feel like crying looking all those disaster, airports broken, roads tore apart, electricity poles down, bad water supply disturbed and so on and so on. Now for a country where it takes 2 years to decide and construct a 15 kilometer road, i wonder how is this big shock going to be recovered. The capital city is crumbling down. The poor country where the people could ride vehicles would be reduced, more electricity cuts more bad sanitation and so on. My heart is crying for my country. My parents and my family is safe from the little or no communication i had.

Within the time i was dialing numbers like mad without any success but a little hope; i get to speak 7 minutes to my loved ones. I was so tired calling my love, maybe her phone died, usually her phone is on the verge of dying. I wanted to call her friend as she said she was with her, i couldn’t get her number, Nor my new phone had any numbers who i knew would know her. I couldn’t get to call her parents or friends. I was so hopeless.
In a sense, i realized how information is power. a 10 digit number would have made me call her, at least raise the possibility. I called my mom, thankfully she was receiving, i talked everything was fine. I asked her to call kittu, she said will do and i hung up. I asked my 2 friends who were sporadically posting status in Facebook to call her and tell me what she is doing, No on got a positive answer, her phone died for sure. I was super worried. Why wouldn’t i, i love her a lot and had to leave her alone to suffer?

I thought how would i helped her if i were there in Nepal. I wonder now what she is doing. Its already 11PM and where she had slipped and what she had eaten? Is she secure and properly nutrition? Is she having to deal with local people who act pervert? Does she have money at the time, i mean cash, to buy things? Did she get to talk to her parents and relatives there in Kathmandu and in her hometown Chitwan? Ohh, i thought and thought and couldn’t stop. Im still thinking about her. I successfully talked to her brother after going through my internet usage to find out any phone numbers who are related to her. I found her brothers phone. He received it and said she is with her friend and he gave me her number. The number never went. That phone might be dead too?

I was working but my mind was on what…. ooh She messaged on viber. ooh finally relieved to hear she is in good shape but sad i couldn’t be there to take care of her in those intense moments. She is reported to be there with lots of local dwellers and her friends. She says its still tremors there. Oh my god. God its over. Please leave our poor people.

Oh i talked to my dad frequently to share the notice i get from Nepal. I had lots of friends in Japan, Jyo and Luiz expressing grief about my country’s situation and my family. I talked to Jeni and she said everything was fine but everyone shocked. She then disagreed on 2 sentence saying i got 14% battery left.

I don’t know how is the condition with our house at Chandol neither i got the word. Everything is good in Chitwan. I hope the same there but right now all i care is that my loved ones are safe and be safe though this day. I hope and pray nothing bad will happen tonight. I pray for no more shock and quake. I just miss my country, i miss my love and family. Oh god, i mostly miss my love. What the fuck timing for this quake to happen? Could it not be when i was in Nepal. I would have cared her, I’m super worried about her because amongst all she is the vulnerable one and the most precious one. God please save her for me, keep her safe. Keep all the people safe and its enough.

My heart is with all my family, my loved ones and thinking what terrible suffering they are though. I can imagine resources depleting, roads obstructed and thousands of people obstructed to reach their family on the outskirts of kathmandu valley. Everything is a mess.  I am yet to hear from Kriti for the new update, she is fine but i really miss not being with her now.

Some transcripts as they happen:

Oh thank god i get to talk to her for a brief moment. I was so relieved after hours of trying to reach her. I then started watching news and forecasts till 5 am in Tokyo and then my eyes needed rest. I woke up 3 times in between 10am to check if everything was okay back home. My mom called me at 10:30 am and we spoke for a couple of minutes and she said how hard the times are in Nepal but asked me not to worry much because my hometown was relatively safe. But all i could wonder was what my dear was going through in the capital where everything is broken right now, how much worse; its unseen right now.
