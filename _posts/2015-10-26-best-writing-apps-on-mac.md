<p>“We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.”<br />― Anaïs Nin</p><p>Civilization is possible because we know how to write. Writing is transcending, is a prolifc tool to pass knowledge to the future. Its a snowball of knowledge, esentially a way to know more than all the generations combined before us within the same lifetime. Writing is art. Art is not easily understood science which sometimes is magical, sometimes extraordinary. So are the books that makes you ponder and makes you change who you are. But the root, someone has to write. Writing is a art. And for me, as a Software Engineer, i need to write a lot of code. I prefer to user beautiful and inspiring IDE rather than complex and functionally blown IDE. I prefer art and i hope all of you do. Today i want to show something artisitic about Mac apps that inspires me note things.</p><p>The first app i love and use daily is <strong><a title="Day One" href="http://dayoneapp.com" target="_blank">Day One.</a> </strong>Its a journaling app. You write daily activities. Dead Simple and the app does that dead simple. You open the app, type anything at all mostly about the day, or week if you are super (lazy or busy). The first quote is the main aim of this app. Reason i use it is, i collect experience- bad and good, new knowledge, sadness and what i did on that particular day even sometimes with photos. I am amused with how would i react when i have time to read what i did 10 years from now. Thats awesome, i would want to do that. All you take with the time is the memory. Lets make it concrete.</p><p><code>[video width="1348" height="1040" mp4="http://kandelvijaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dayone.mp4"][/video]</code></p><code><a href="http://kandelvijaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1445174277_full.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://kandelvijaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1445174277_thumb.png" align="middle" class="aligncenter"></a></code><p><code> </code></p><p></p>[code language="plain"]Second, Quiver:Programmers notebook i do a lot of coding and code are little different from normal literature. They have colors and weight and different styling; not because they are needed but because programming a computer is tedious and to make it a little visually helpful we need colorsense and weights. I dont like to use 2 apps to do one thing if i can. Quiver is a awesome tool to mix code samples with the normal text. For me its a powerful tool to be note and study.
Third: Pure writing tool, iA for authors, bloggers or note takers. The interface is simple and minimal putting all the focus on text. The typography feels inspiring and overall you just wonder how good it feels to write a page. You want to continue even if you are done. I am huge fan of it. I highly recommend for anyone.[/code]<br /><br /><p></p><p><code><code>[video width="1808" height="1088" mp4="http://kandelvijaya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iWriter.mp4"][/video]</code></code></p><p>Lastly: <strong>Blogo. </strong><a title="Blogo App" href="https://www.getblogo.com" target="_blank">Blogo</a> helps you write Wordpress blogs from the standalone Mac app and publish with a push button. Edit photos, make pages, put links and edit styles, all is in the text editor. Interesting it syncs your post to the Evernote if you choose to, which i recommend. I dont trust wordpress and have lost 4 times with it. This feature is the reason im recommending this app. If you wanna know why; <a title="Losing the war with wordpress" href="http://kandelvijaya.com/index.php/2015/10/18/losing-the-war-with-wordpress/" target="_blank">i wrote a post on that too</a>. Let me know if you have your favorites.</p>
